# What is a Provisional Approval?

A **provisional approval** means your application **appears to meet** the registration requirements, but your supporting documents **have not yet been fully reviewed.** The Registrar will conduct a full review of your registration at a later date. **You may operate** your short-term rental using the registration number above unless otherwise notified.

Upon full review, you will receive confirmation of the final result. If the Registrar determines that requirements are not met, your registration **may be cancelled or suspended**. In that case, you will have an opportunity to submit further information for consideration.
